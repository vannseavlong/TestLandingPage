 * This file has been reorganized into modular CSS files:
 * - button/button.css - All button styles
 * - navbar/navbar.css - Navigation bar styles  
 * - footer/footer.css - Footer styles
 * - section/global.css - Global styles and animations shared across sections
 * - section/sectionA.css - Section A specific styles and responsive design
 * - section/sectionB.css - Section B specific styles and responsive design
 * - section/sectionC.css - Section C specific styles and responsive design
 * 
 * Each component now imports its own CSS file for better maintainability.

/* Only global styles remain here if needed for legacy support */
